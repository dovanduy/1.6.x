<soft_delete_explain>
If a user deletes emails, calendar items or complete folders, there are by default moved to the Deleted Items folder.[br]
When the items are removed from the Deleted Items, the items still will not be fully removed from the database.[br]Rather, they are marked as deleted, so the user does not see the items. Even when a user deletes items with <SHIFT> <delete> they are not removed from the database, but marked as deleted.
This makes restoring of items quick and easy from Outlook: choose Extra from the menu bar in Outlook menu, and click on Restore deleted items. Items are grouped by the folder they were deleted from. Most items will appear in the Deleted Items folder as they have been removed from that location.
Soft deletes always remain in the database, until they are purged.

When a item will be purged is dependent of a configuration value.[br]
This option defines how long a deleted item will remain in the database:[br]
Softdelete LifeTime: 30 Days[br]
In this example, the value is set to 30.[br]This means that deleted items will be purged from the
database 30 days after they were deleted.[br]When this option is set to 0, the items will never be
removed from the database</softdelete_lifetime_explain>

<min_subqueue_msgs_explain>The router put messages in a subqueue per each process set in this section.[br]
If this parameter is set to 0 the SMTP process will parse it's queue and send every mail stored in it's queue in realtime.[br]
If the router put only 1 message in subqueue, the SMTP process will create a remote connection to send this mail.[br]
To safe connections to the targeted server and send the desired X messages, the SMTP process must buffer enough messages in it's queue before trying to process.[br]
This parameter force each process to wait X messages stored in it's queue before processing messages.

<zarafa_tune_explain>For performace reasons, it is strongly recommended to set the cache settings of the Zarafa server
appropriate for your setup/server.[br]
Each time a request on an item can be found in the cache (cache hits), this avoids calls to other processes and disks/storage.[br]
Setting sensible cache settings certainly increases the performance.[br]
In a server purely running Zarafa, it is advisable to set caches to use around 80% (in total -- including MySQL) 
of the RAM available in your server and can be considered to be a rule-of-thumb.[br]
The other 20% should be free for system processes, other processes (like your MTA) and the web server.[br]
Whenever you set the values too high this can result in the use of swap on your server.[br]
Swapping should be avoided, but we do want to make use of the RAM available.[br]
Therefore these settings should be a healthy balance between the risk of swapping and efficient caching in memory.
</zarafa_tune_explain>
<cache_cell_size>Cache cell size</cache_cell_size>

<zcache_cell_size_explain>
Size in MB of the cell cache.[br]
This is the main cache used in Zarafa.[br]
It caches all data that comes into view in tables (e.g. the view of your inbox, or any other folder).[br]
In an ideal situation, all cells would be cached, so that the database does not need to be queried 
for data when browsing through folders, but this would require around 1.5K per message item (email, appointment task, etc) 
in the entire server.[br]
If you can afford it, set this value as high as possible, up to 50% of your total RAM capacity.

<vm.vfs_cache_pressure>This variable controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of VFS caches,
versus pagecache and swap.[br]Increasing this value increases the rate at which VFS caches are reclaimed.[br]
It is difficult to know when this should be changed, other than by experimentation.[br]The slabtop command (part of the package procps) shows top memory objects used 
by the kernel.[br]The vfs caches are the "dentry" and the "*_inode_cache" objects.[br]
If these are consuming a large amount of memory in relation to pagecache, it may be worth trying to increase pressure.[br]
Could also help to reduce swapping. The default value is 100. </vm.vfs_cache_pressure>
<vm.min_free_kbytes>
Sets the value of each page’s zone to min, low, or high, depending on themachine.[br]
Default is 724.[br]
For a small machine use 128 KB; for largemachines, use the maximum 4096 KB.[br]
Example: For a machine with more than 8GByte RAM you can easily spare 128MByte (which would translate into a sysctl value of 131072, as it has to be given in kByte).
</vm.min_free_kbytes>
<vm.nr_hugepages>
Try to allocate or deallocate hugepages dynamically.[br] 
The success of this operation depends on the amount of memory that is present in the system for this operation.[br]
Default is 0.
</vm.nr_hugepages>
<kernel.panic_on_oops>
Enable kernel detection and handling of any process that causes a crashand calls the panic() function at the end.[br]
The kernel.panic parameter must also be set to 1. Default is 1 (enable).
</kernel.panic_on_oops>
<vm.overcommit_ratio>
Percentage of memory that is allowed for overcommit.[br]Default is 50.[br]
It represents the percentage of physical RAM that along with the entire swap forms the total address space (allocatable memory).[br]
Yes, the naming is confusing, since there is no overcommitting.[br]
The default is 50 so, quite unintuitively, only half of the RAM will be used.[br]
Seeing that the swap is the only component that can change dynamically it would have made sense to specify a percentage for that.[br]
Anyway, there are 2 ways to ensure that the allocatable memory will be equal to the RAM size:[br]
1. make the swap the same size as the RAM and set vm.overcommit_ratio=0 - that will work as long as the swap is in use, 
but as soon as a swapoff is done (manually or during shutdown), you're in for a nasty surprise: no more memory can be allocated.[br]
At all! New programs will fail to start.[br][br]
2. Set vm.overcommit_ratio=100 and disable the swap.[br]
This is a stable setup and the preferred method on a machine with enough RAM.[br]
Web servers are slowed down anyway by swapping and careful planning will help ensuring that the memory 
usage limits won't be reached (by setting cache sizes, maximum number of processes, etc.).
[br]
</vm.overcommit_ratio>
<vm.overcommit_memory>
Processes commonly allocate memory by calling the function malloc().[br]
The kernel decides if enough RAM is available and either grants or denies the allocation request.[br]
Linux (and a few other Unix-variants) support the ability to over-commit memory; that is, to permit more memory to be allocated than is available 
in physical RAM plus swap.[br]
This is scary, but sometime necessary since applications commonly allocate memory for "worst case" scenarios but never use it.
</vm.overcommit_memory>
<vm.swappiness>
Determines how likely the VM subsystem is to swap to disk.[br]
Default is 60 and typically is sufficient. [br]
Valid values are 0 to 100.[br]
</vm.swappiness>
<vm.lower_zone_protection>
If running the 32-bit hugemem kernel isn't an option either, you can try
setting to a value of 250 or more.[br]
This will cause the kernel to try to be more aggressive in defending the
low zone from allocating memory that could potentially be allocated in
the high memory zone.[br]Some experimentation to find the best setting
for your environment will probably be necessary.

<samba_security_mode_explain>There are only two types of security modes for Samba, share-level and user-level, 
which are collectively known as security levels.[br]
Share-level security can only be implemented in one way, while user-level security can be implemented in one of four different ways.[br]
The different ways of implementing a security level are called security modes.
</samba_security_mode_explain>
<samba_security_mode>Samba Security Mode</samba_security_mode>
<user_level_security>User-Level security</user_level_security>
<user_level_security_explain>
User-level security is the default setting for Samba.[br]
If the server accepts the client's username/password, the client can then mount multiple shares without specifying a password for each instance.[br]
Samba can also accept session-based username/password requests.[br]
The client maintains multiple authentication contexts by using a unique UID for each logon.
</user_level_security_explain>
<share_level_security>Share-Level Security</share_level_security>
<share_level_security_explain>With share-level security, the server accepts only a password without an explicit username from the client.[br]
The server expects a password for each share, independent of the username.[br]
There have been recent reports that Microsoft Windows clients have compatibility issues with share-level security servers.</share_level_security_explain>
<domain_security>Domain security</domain_security>

<WARN_SQUID_STATS_PERFS>It seems that your server did not have recommended performances
it seems that your server has no necessary performance handle both advanced Artica statistics feature and Proxy services.[br]
We recommend at least have 3 GB memory and two processors.[br]
Artica use MySQL in order to store data and display charts and graphs.[br]
Gradually the MySQL database will growth and will consume server performance.
[br][br][b]You have 3 solutions to continue.[/b][br]
[br]
[b]The first is to continue for testing purpose.[/b][br][br]
If you want to test charts and graphs generated by Artica with not many users, you can click on the "I understand,continue anyway" button.[br]
In this case this warning will disappear and the statistics engine will continue to run.[br]
[br]
[b]Second is to disable the Artica statistics engine.[/b][br][br]
By clicking on the button "Stop Artica Statistics engine", the MySQL database will be cleaned and the statistics engine will be stopped and the statistics section 
will disappear.[br]
Before clicking on the button visits links below in order to enable reduced statistics by using the Sarg software and generate CSV logs files.[br]
[br][br]
[b]Third is to use a remote server for statistics generation.[/b][br][br]
The Artica Proxy statistics appliance is designed to unload proxies statistics and Web filtering tasks.[br]
This appliance will be in charge to centralize statistics for several proxies.[br]
It designed to provide centralized Antivirus and Web filtering services.[br]

<INNODB_FILE_PER_TABLE_ASK>Currently, the MySQL engine is set to store indexes in a single file.[br]
Having everything in one big file means all tables and indexes, from all schemes, are 'mixed' together in that file.[br]
We recommend to split this file with the innodb_file_per_table parameter.[br]This parameter create a .ibd file for each table Instead of using one large ibdata file for all data.[br]
Having a file per table will give more flexibility to move tables to different filesystem partitions for better performance.[br] 
In this case:[br] 
[br]Tablespace is not shared among different tables, and certainly not among different schemes.[br]
Each file is considered a tablespace of its own.[br]
tablespace never reduces in size.[br]
It is possible to regain space per tablespace.[br]
[br]

[b]What to do ?[/b][br]
[br]1) You can [b]keep current settings[/b] and this message will disapear.[br]
In this case click on the button "I understand,continue anyway".[br]
[br]2) You can turn to InnoDB file per table but choose this option will take your server busy during the conversion procedure.[br]The procedure made by Artica will be:[br]
dump all MySQL tables to a local directory (you need at least [b]%free[/b] free space size).[br]
Remove all tables on your MySQL server ( about %tablesnum tables).[br]
Stop the MySQL server engine.[br]
Start the MySQL server engine.[br]
Import %tablesnum tables on your MySQL server.

<KernelSendRedirects_explain>This option tells the Linux kernel to send out ICMP redirects to other hosts.[br]
This should only be turned on, if the computer acts as a router of some sort.[br]
The ICMP redirects are mainly sent out to hosts, 
if we for example know that the other router/host should instead contact another server on their same subnet as the one we are receiving the packets on.
The send_redirects variable takes a boolean value and is per default turned on.[br]
It can take the values 0 (off) and 1 (on).[br]
In most cases where the computer is not running as a router of some kind, we could safely turn it off.

<map_untrusted_to_domain>Map untrusted to domain</map_untrusted_to_domain>
<map_untrusted_to_domain_explain>Previously, when this server was a domain member and a client was connecting using an
untrusted domain name, such as BOGUS\user the server would remap the untrusted domain to the primary domain 
server was a member of and attempt authentication using that DOMAIN\user name.[br]
This differed from how a Windows member server would behave.[br]
Now, the server will replace the BOGUS name with it's SAM name.[br]
In the case where server is acting as a PDC this will be DOMAIN\user.[br]
In the case where this server is acting as a domain member server this will be WORKSTATION\user.[br]
Thus, server will never assume that an incoming user name which is not qualified
with the same primary domain, is part of server's primary domain.[br]
While this behavior matches Windows, it may break some workflows which depended
on server to always pass through bogus names to the DC for verification.[br]this 
parameter "map untrusted to domain" can be [b]checked[/b] to revert to the legacy behavior.

<cache_replacement_policy_explain>The cache replacement policy parameter determines which objects are evicted (replaced) when disk space is needed.[br][br]
The LRU policies keeps recently referenced objects.[br][br]
The [b]heap GDSF policy[/b] optimizes object hit rate by keeping smaller popular objects in cache so it has a better chance of getting a hit.[br]
It achieves a lower byte hit rate than LFUDA though since it evicts larger (possibly popular) objects.[br]
[br][br][b]The heap LFUDA policy[/b] keeps popular objects in cache regardless of their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate at the expense of hit rate since one large, 
popular object will prevent many smaller, slightly less popular objects from being cached.[br][br]
Both policies utilize a dynamic aging mechanism that prevents cache pollution that can otherwise occur with frequency-based replacement policies.[br][br]

<SPNEGO_explain>Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO), 
often pronounced "spen-go", is a GSSAPI "pseudo mechanism" 
that is used to negotiate one of a number of possible real mechanisms.[br]
SPNEGO is used when a client application wants to authenticate to a remote server,
but neither end is sure what authentication protocols the other supports.[br]
The pseudo-mechanism uses a protocol to determine what common GSSAPI mechanisms are available, 
selects one and then dispatches all further security operations to it.[br]
This can help organizations deploy new security mechanisms in a phased manner.
</SPNEGO_explain>
<client_use_spnego_principal_explain>
This parameter determines whether or not smbclient and other samba components acting as a client will attempt 
to use the server-supplied principal sometimes given in the SPNEGO exchange.[br]
If enabled, Samba can attempt to use Kerberos to contact servers known only by IP address.[br]
Kerberos relies on names, so ordinarily cannot function in this situation.[br]
If disabled, Samba will use the name used to look up the server when asking the KDC for a ticket.[br]
This avoids situations where a server may impersonate another, soliciting authentication as one principal 
while being known on the network as another.[br]
Note that Windows XP SP2 and later versions already follow this behaviour, 
and Windows Vista/Windows 7 and later servers no longer supply this 'rfc4178 hint' principal on the server side.
</client_use_spnego_principal_explain>
<client_use_spnego_explain>
This variable controls whether Samba clients will try to use Simple and Protected NEGOciation (as specified by rfc2478)
with supporting servers (including WindowsXP, Windows2000 and Samba 3.0)
to agree upon an authentication mechanism.[br]
This enables Kerberos authentication in particular.

<caches_rules_min>
Using this parameter, you can specify the time for which the object or response should be stored on cache.[br]
The default and recommended value for this parameter is 0 because altering it may cause problems or unexpected behavior 
with dynamic web pages.[br]
You can use a higher value when you are absolutely sure that a website doesn't supply any dynamic content.
</caches_rules_min>
<caches_rules_max>
this value is the minimum and maximum times for which a cached object is considered to be stored on cache.[br]
If a cached object has spent more time in the cache than this value, then it won't be considered fresh anymore.[br]
You should note that the [b]Expires[/b] HTTP header overrides minimal and maximal values.
</caches_rules_max>

<caches_rules_percent>
It determines the life of a cached object in the absence of the Expires headers.[br]
An object's life time is considered to be the difference between the times extracted from
the [b]Last-Modified and Date headers[/b].[br]
So, if we set the value of percent to 50 , and the difference between the times from Last-Modified and Date headers 
is one hour, then the object will be considered to be stored on cache for the next 30 minutes.[br]
The response age is simply the time that has passed since the response was generated by the web server or 
was validated by the proxy server for the freshness.[br]
The ratio of the response age to the object life time is termed as lm-factor.

which will eventually enforce the use of minimal value to determine the freshness of an object.[br]
This option is of no use, if you have set the minimal value to zero.
</override-lastmod>

<reload-into-ims>
 will force proxy to convert the [b]no-cache[/b] directives in the HTTP headers to 
 the [b]If-Modified-Since headers[/b].[br]
The use of this option is useful only when the [b]Last-Modified[/b] header is present.
</reload-into-ims>

<ignore-reload>
Simply ignore the [b]no-cache[/b] or [b]reload[/b] directives present in the HTTP headers
</ignore-reload>

<ignore-no-store>
The HTTP header [b]Cache-Control: no-store[/b] is used to tell clients that they are not allowed 
to store the data being transmitted.[br] If set, Proxy will simply ignore this HTTP header 
and will cache the response if it's cacheable.
</ignore-no-store>

<ignore-must-revalidate>
The HTTP header [b]Cache-Control: must-revalidate[/b]
means that the response must be revalidated with the originating web server before it's used again.[br]
if set, it will enforce proxy to ignore this header.
</ignore-must-revalidate>

<ignore-private>
Private information or sensitive data generally carries an HTTP header known as [b]Cache-Control: private[/b] 
so that intermediate servers don't cache the responses.[br]
However, this option can be used to ignore this header.
</ignore-private>

<ignore-auth>
Proxy will be able to cache the authorization requests.[br]
Using this option may be really risky
</ignore-auth>

<refresh-ims>
Forces proxy to validate the cached object with the original server whenever 
an [b]If-Modified-Since[/b] request header is received from a client.[br]
Using this may increase the latency, but the clients will always get the latest data.
</refresh-ims>
<store-stale>
Force Proxy to stores responses even if they don't have explicit reshness or a validator (i.e., Last-Modified or an ETag)[br] 
present, or if they're already stale.[br] By default, Proxy will not cache such responses because they usually can't be
reused.[br]Note that such responses will be stale by default

<captive_portal_explain>The captive portal technique forces an HTTP client on a network to see a special 
web page (usually for authentication purposes) before using the Internet normally.[br]
A captive portal turns a Web browser into an authentication device.[br]
This is done by intercepting most packets, regardless of address or port, until the user opens a browser 
and tries to access the web.[br]
At that time the browser is redirected to a web page which may require authentication and/or payment, 
or simply display an acceptable use policy and require the user to agree.[br]
Captive portals are used at many Wi-Fi hotspots, and can be used to control wired access (e.g. apartment houses, hotel rooms, business centers, 
"open" Ethernet jacks) as well.[br]
Since the login page itself must be presented to the client, either that login page is 
locally stored in the gateway, or the web server hosting that page must be "whitelisted" 
via a walled garden to bypass the authentication process.[br]
Depending on the feature set of the gateway, multiple web servers can be whitelisted (say for iframes or links within the login page).[br]
In addition to whitelisting the URLs of web hosts, some gateways can whitelist TCP ports.[br]
The MAC address of attached clients can also be set to bypass the login process.[br]

<memory_pools_explain>If set, Proxy service will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory

<memory_pools_limit_explain>
If set to a non-zero value, Proxy service will keep at most the specified
limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools.
All free() requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc library.
Proxy service does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps objects that otherwise would be free()d.[br]
Thus, it is safe to set memory pools limit to a reasonably high value even if your configuration will use less memory.[br]
If set to 0, Squid will keep all memory it can.[br]
That is, there 	will be no limit on the total amount of memory used for safe-keeping.[br]
An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
when the limit is checked.[br]This overhead is close to four bytes per object kept.[br]
However, pools may actually _save_ memory because of reduced memory thrashing in your malloc library.

<dnot_proxy_lisResolvable_explain>
If the DNS inside the network recognizes only internal hosts, 
you can use this option to test whether a host name is internal or external to the network.[br]
Using this option, you can configure the browser to use direct connections to internal servers and 
to use the proxy only for external servers.[br]
This option is useful at sites where the internal hosts inside the firewall are able to resolve the 
DNS domain name of other internal hosts, but all external hosts are unresolvable.[br] Browsers consults DNS, attempting to resolve the host name into an IP address.[br]

<WCCP_LAYER3_EXPLAIN>The Artica Caching Proxy Server have to be in the same Interface to the Clients , 
it is the only topology which ASA supported the WCCP , 
for example  you cannot run the Proxy Server in the management Network to use it for web redirection in the production Network.[br]
The configuration of a Cisco Router or a Layer 3 Switch is very similar to the ASA.[br]
First of all you have to create two ACLs , with the first ACL you tell the ASA who and where is (are) 
the Artica Caching Proxy Sever, You can name this ACL "wccp-server" :[br]
Our ASA as 172.16.1.254 IP address, Artica proxy server as  172.16.1.100 IP address, clients network is 172.16.1.0/224
[br][code]access-list wccp-server extended permit ip host 172.16.1.100 any[/code][br]
With the other ACL you declare the clients and the traffic which should be intercepted.[br]
But off course you have to remove the proxy server from the client ACL:[br]
[code]access-list wccp-traffic line 1 extended deny ip host 172.16.8.100 any[br]
access-list wccp-traffic line 2 extended permit tcp ip 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 any eq www[/code][br]
Then you configure the WCCP protocol on the ASA and apply it to the interface, in this case the production interface.[br]
[code]wccp web-cache redirect-list wccp-traffic group-list wccp-server[br]
wccp interface production web-cache redirect in[/code][br]
you can always control and debugging you configuration by using :[code]show wccp[/code][br]
Next you have to set in the form the IP address of the ASA ( 172.16.1.254 ) in this case.

<squid_identd_daemon_explain>
The Ident Protocol (Identification Protocol, IDENT), specified in RFC 1413, is an Internet protocol that helps identify the user of a particular TCP connection.[br]
The Identification daemon allows you to identify your users based on log in name.[br]
This simplifies management so you don't have to go around matching IP addresses to computers.[br]
Of course it also allows you to add users to groups based on their username.[br]
Using this feature for user authentication has several benefits over the SSL or proxy login methods.[br]
Primarily that the user does not need to enter username and password credentials to access trough Internet.[br]
Instead, an Ident service running on the client system will automatically provide the Windows username to the proxy.[br]
[b]You have to install a tool ( provided bellow ) on each computer.[br]
[br]You have to allow [b]TCP port 113[/b] through all internal software firewalls.[br]
Note that unlike earlier versions of Windows, Windows Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8 no longer 
reject packets sent to port 113 if no running Ident server is found.[br]
This will result in no website being displayed in the browser.[br]
Consequently all machines must have an Ident server installed if you use Ident on your network.

<SquidClientDSTPassThru>DNS mismatch checking</SquidClientDSTPassThru>
<SquidClientDSTPassThru_explain>With NAT or TPROXY intercepted traffic Proxy may pass the request
directly to the original client destination IP or seek a faster source using the HTTP Host header.[br]
Using Host to locate alternative servers can provide faster connectivity with a range of failure recovery options.[br]
But can also lead to connectivity trouble when the client and server are attempting stateful interactions unaware 
of the proxy.[br]
This option (if checked) prevents alternative DNS entries being	located to send intercepted 
traffic DIRECT to an origin server.[br]
The clients original destination IP and port will be used instead.[br]
Regardless of this option setting, when dealing with intercepted traffic Proxy will verify the Host: header 
and any traffic which fails Host verification will be treated as if this option is enabled.

<persistent_connections_explain>
HTTP persistent connection, also called HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, 
is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, 
as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.[br]
If HTTP persistent connections are enabled, it will force the proxy to keep open connections at increase CPU consumption.[br]
By default, HTTP persistent connections are disabled.

<cache_mem_explain2>
As a rule of thumb on proxy uses approximately 14 MB of RAM per GB of the total of all caches saved in cache center, plus your this memory setting and about an additional 10-20MB.[br]
It is recommended to have at least twice this amount of physical RAM available.[br]
The recommended extra RAM besides what is used by proxy is used by the operating system to improve disk I/O performance and 
by other applications or services running on the server.[br]
If you have a low memory server, and a large disk, then you will not necessarily be able to use all the disk space, 
since as the cache fills the memory available will be insufficient, forcing proxy to swap out memory and affecting performance.[br]
A very large cache on disk total and insufficient physical RAM + Swap could cause proxy to stop functioning completely.[br]
The solution for larger caches is to get more physical RAM; allocating more to proxy via this setting will not help.

If spammers ever try to resend rejected messages, we can assume they will not stay idle between 
the two sends (if they do, the spam problem would just be solved).[br]
Odds are good that the spammer will send a mail to a honey pot address and get blacklisted in several real-time distributed black lists before the second attempt.

<APP_HYPERCACHE_WEB>Hyper Cache Web</APP_HYPERCACHE_WEB>
<enforce_rules_explain>Over the years, Web pages have become more complex,
making Web page loads notoriously slow even though the
underlying network has signifcantly improved.[br]The situation is worse for the mobile scenario, 
partly due to the lowercompute power available on these devices, and partly due to network inefciencies.[br]
Many web servers did not follow HTTP standards by forcing the proxy [b]To not cache[/b] web pages.[br]
Web servers use CDN websites (Content delivery Network) that multiply sources of objects.[br]
With these new behaviors, the standard proxy cache method is not able to increase cache rate.[br]
This feature allows you to create rules for specific websites.[br]These rules are able to drive your proxy server to retreive downloaded objects in order to serve it trough a local web server.
</enforce_rules_explain>
<artica_cache_rule_explain_sitename>Give here the Web site you want to Hyper cache.[br]
The website should be the global domain website: ibm.com or sourceforge.net.[br]

<APP_SS5>Socket Secure Proxy</APP_SS5>
<APP_SS5_ABOUT>Socket Secure (SOCKS) is an Internet protocol that routes network packets 
between a client and server through a proxy server.[br]
SOCKS5 additionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server.[br]
Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded.[br]
SOCKS performs at Layer 5 of the OSI model (the session layer, an intermediate layer between the presentation layer and the transport layer).</APP_SS5_ABOUT>

Certain servers emit the non-standard Alternate-Protocol header without listing it as 
Connection header and popular client software will attempt to follow its instructions regardless of the presence of
a proxy.[br]This may result in loss of administrative information about
client traffic, increased network bandwidth, unpredictable client
failures, loss of connectivity for the client, information leakage

<warning_bigdata_v3_explain>If you read this message, this mean your Big Database service is on 0.9.1,0.9.2 version.[br]
We have released a new 0.9.3 version that improve Database service engine performance.[br]
This new version have a new compress engine in order to reduce data size and memory usage on the system disk.[br]
To use this new version you must [b]destroy[/b] the current database built in 0.9.2 or 0.9.1 version.[br]
If you upgrade to the 0.9.3 or above version without removing the database, you will be able to extract statistics but Artica will [b]be not able to inject new data[/b].[br]
We will develop a new feature to inject old logs to the BigData database.[br]
So if you need to keep history and continue to add data, do not upgrade to 0.9.3 Database Engine or above.[br]
If you want to have better performances and upgrade with a freshed database, upgrade to the new engine and remove the database in the statistics engine section.

<groups_retreiver_explain>For statistics purpose and for specifics ACLs Artica need to retrieve only one group from an user.[br]
Active Directory allows you to link multiple groups for an user but Artica needs to retreive only one.[br]
By default, Artica use the first group found in the group list.[br]
You can define a regular expression if you need to retrieve a specific group.[br]
For example: [b]^INTERNET_[/b] will find the first group started by INTERNET_ keywords like ( INTERNET_FULL, INTERNET_MEDIUM...).[br]
Or you can choose an Active Directory attribute in the drop-down list that allows Artica to set it as group.

<integrated_antivirus_explain>Integrated Antivirus act as an Antivirus plugin ( using eCAP library ), difference is the proxy not sends content to a ClamAV engine service, the Antivirus analysis is a part of the Proxy process.[br]
This reduce used resources by an additional service but increase memory used by the proxy itself.[br]
With this plugin, the Antivirus send directly an [b]Access Denied[/b] to the proxy, in this case no statistics and information are sent to the system.

<http_compression_explain>HTTP compression allows you to compress HTTP content into gzip format.[br]
All browsers supports gzip format and are able to uncompress content ( using the [b]Accept-Encoding	gzip, deflate[/b] HTTP header).[br]
It designed to save bandwidth and compress content from 40 to 95%.[br]
In most cases the GZIP compress operation is executed on Web servers but many web servers did not have HTTP compression feature enabled.[br]
This feature is interesting if your proxy is located on the main office and serves browsers or remote proxies that are located oustide your local infrastructure.[br]
Using HTTP compression inside a LAN did not make sense...
